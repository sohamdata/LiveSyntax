# LiveSyntax

A code editor that allows multiple users to edit the same code in real-time.

## Setup local development environment:
- requirements:  nodejs and npm
- clone this repo
- cd into the root directory
- install dependencies (this will install dependencies for both the client and server)
```bash
npm install
npm run install:all
```

- rename the .env.example file in the client directory to .env then edit it to your liking

Run this command in the root directory
```bash
npm run dev
```

or do it manually for better debugging

start server: 
```bash 
cd server
npm run dev
```

start client:
```bash 
cd client
npm run dev
```

```
